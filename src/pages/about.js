        I have had a quite interesting journey during my professional life
        spanning from being a dental assistant to managing inventory for large
        scale events like Coachella and the Oscars. It was my obsession with attention to detail 
        and finding creative solutions that motivated my interest in web development.

        When I am not learning or teaching, I like to enjoy nature, hikes and researching ways to be efficiently environmental friendly.
